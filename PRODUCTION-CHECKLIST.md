# 🚀 Canvas Weaver Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ **Completed Production Fixes**

### 🔧 **Code Quality & Security**
- ✅ **Debug Logging Removed**: Replaced console.log with production Logger class
- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Added config-based WebSocket URLs and CORS settings
- ✅ **CORS Security**: Restricted to specific domains (Figma + Chrome extension)
- ✅ **Production Build Scripts**: Automated minification and optimization
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Production-ready error tracking foundation

### 📦 **Build System**
- ✅ **Production Build Script**: `npm run build:production`
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: `.env` configuration support
- ✅ **Bundle Optimization**: Minified JavaScript and removed source maps
- ✅ **Server Configuration**: Production vs development modes

## 🔍 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### **Environment Setup**
- [ ] Copy `env.example` to `.env` and configure production values
- [ ] Update `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID_PROD` with actual extension ID
- [ ] Set `WS_URL_PROD` to production WebSocket server URL
- [ ] Configure `CORS_ORIGINS_PROD` with actual production domains

### **Security Review**
- [ ] Verify CORS origins are restricted to required domains only
- [ ] Ensure no API keys or secrets are hardcoded
- [ ] Confirm all debug logging is disabled in production
- [ ] Review Chrome extension permissions for minimal requirements

### **Testing**
- [ ] Test plugin loading in Figma Desktop
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections work with production URLs
- [ ] Test Chrome extension integration end-to-end
- [ ] Validate component generation with real images
- [ ] Performance test with large images

### **Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] Configure error tracking service (Sentry recommended)
- [ ] Set up server monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement user analytics (optional)
- [ ] Configure logging aggregation

### **Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy WebSocket server to production infrastructure
- [ ] Upload Chrome extension to Chrome Web Store
- [ ] Submit Figma plugin to Figma Community (if public)
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets (if needed)

## 🛠 **Commands for Production**

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:production

# Start production server
npm run start:server:prod

# Test production build locally
NODE_ENV=production npm run start:server
```

## 🔒 **Security Considerations**

### **Server Security**
- ✅ CORS properly configured for specific origins
- ✅ Request size limits in place (50MB max)
- ✅ No sensitive data logged in production
- [ ] HTTPS/WSS enabled for production deployment
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented (recommended)

### **Client Security**
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in client code
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- [ ] CSP headers configured (if serving web content)
- [ ] Extension permissions minimized

## 📊 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Bundle Size**
- ✅ Debug code removed in production builds
- ✅ Tree shaking enabled for unused code elimination
- ✅ Minification for all JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Gzip compression enabled on server

### **Runtime Performance**
- ✅ Efficient WebSocket connection management
- ✅ Image processing optimized for large files
- [ ] Caching strategy for processed results (optional)
- [ ] CDN integration for static assets (if applicable)

## 🚨 **Known Limitations & Considerations**

1. **WebSocket Dependency**: Plugin requires active WebSocket server for full functionality
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome extension limited to Chromium-based browsers
3. **Image Size Limits**: 50MB maximum payload size configured
4. **Processing Time**: Complex images may take 10-30 seconds to process

## 📈 **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
- [ ] Plugin installation and activation rates
- [ ] Component generation success/failure rates
- [ ] Average processing time per image
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] Error rates and types

### **Recommended Tools**
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry, Bugsnag, or Rollbar
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Amplitude
- **Server Monitoring**: New Relic, DataDog, or Grafana
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Pingdom, UptimeRobot, or StatusPage

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

Canvas Weaver is ready for production when:
- ✅ Plugin loads without errors in Figma Desktop
- ✅ UI displays properly with all functionality working
- ✅ WebSocket connections are stable and secure
- ✅ Component generation works with test images
- ✅ Chrome extension integration is functional
- [ ] All production environment variables are configured
- [ ] Monitoring and error tracking are operational
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds (<30s for typical images)
