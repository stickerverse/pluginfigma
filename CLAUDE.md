Excellent idea. Integrating our recent discussion into your core project directive will keep the team aligned and focused on what matters.

Here is the improved project overview, with the new insights and directives woven in. I've highlighted the key additions and changes.

Project Directive: Visionary UI
1. Core Mission

Our mission is to build the leading Figma plugin that transforms any static user interface image into a pixel-perfect, production-ready, and fully editable Figma design file. We are turning flat pixels into living, structured, and developer-ready components.

2. Unique Value Proposition & Strategic Positioning

Universal Input (Our Unfair Advantage): Unlike code-based competitors (e.g., html.to.design), our tool works directly from images. This unlocks a vastly larger market, including native mobile apps, competitor products, legacy software, and static mockups—anything that can be screenshotted. We will not deviate from this image-first strategy.

Designer-Centric Output: Our primary goal is Semantic Accuracy (recreating a designer's intent), not literal reproduction. We build clean, organized files with proper Auto Layout, ignoring the "div soup" and implementation artifacts that code-based tools produce. We deliver a file that a senior designer would be proud to have built by hand.

3. The User Experience & Feedback Loop

Transparent Processing: The user must always feel informed and in control. We will implement a visual feedback system using figma.notify() to communicate each stage of our processing pipeline.

Example flow: "Analyzing Image...", "Detecting Layout with AI...", "Generating Figma Layers...", "✅ Success!"

Feel of Interactivity: This active feedback loop is critical for building user trust and making the application feel as responsive and professional as top-tier competitors.

4. Technical Architecture & Accuracy Roadmap

Our pipeline is engineered for maximum precision. We will achieve this through a multi-stage process:

Input: A user-provided UI image (PNG, JPG).

Pre-processing (Quality Enhancement):

Super-Resolution: Implement an AI model (e.g., ESRGAN) to upscale and sharpen low-quality inputs, providing a cleaner source for analysis.

Core Analysis (AI-Powered Deconstruction):

Structure & Shape Detection: Use the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to achieve precise, pixel-mask segmentation of all UI elements. This is non-negotiable for accuracy.

Text Recognition (OCR): Use Tesseract.js to extract text content.

Advanced Font Analysis:

Sub-Pixel Positioning: Analyze anti-aliasing to determine exact character placement.

Font Matching: Implement a "render-and-compare" system using a comprehensive font library (like Google Fonts) and pixelmatch to identify the correct font family, weight, and size with high confidence.

Post-processing (Intelligent Refinement):

Geometric Constraint Solver: This is our "secret sauce" for clean output. This system will automatically:

Quantize Measurements: Snap positions and dimensions to a consistent grid (e.g., 8px).

Enforce Consistency: Standardize properties (colors, radii) across similar, repeating components.

Infer Layout: Deduce spacing and apply Auto Layout properties programmatically.

Generation & Output:

Use the refined data to generate native Figma components via the Plugin API.

The output must be:

Fully editable with native layers.

Intelligently structured with Auto Layout.

Cleanly named and grouped logically.

5. Immediate Technical Priorities

Resolve Core Bugs: Our immediate focus is on ensuring the fundamental "select and paste" workflow is 100% reliable. This involves robust error handling (try...catch) and debugging the UI-to-core message passing.

Implement User Feedback: The notification-based progress indicator is a high-priority feature to improve user experience and perceived performance.
